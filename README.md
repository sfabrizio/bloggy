# Bloggy


Bloggy is a super simple blog  made it in **REACT**,**Node** and **Express** so far!

>This suppose to be a project for play with React/Express. But well It's starting to take shape and I'm going to continue working on it. I want to use it like my personal blog. Maybe someone would like use it or work on this too. That would be great. I'm still have a lot of features/ideas to implement.

----------



Setup
-------------
1. First install dependencies
```
npm install
```

ready, now just start the server..

----------

Start the server
----------

```
npm run server
```

> **Note:**
>  This will make a bundle of the react front end and then it will start the server with that bundle updated.


If you want just run the backend run the follow one:

```
npm run start
```
now you have the backend running on http://localhost:3000/

For start the frontEnd standalone dev server with hot reloading you just need to run:

```
npm run dev
```

now you have a server dev running on http://localhost:8080/



Running the tests
----------

```npm test```
